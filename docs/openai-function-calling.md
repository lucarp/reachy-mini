Function calling
================

Give models access to new functionality and data they can use to follow instructions and respond to prompts.

**Function calling** (also known as **tool calling**) provides a powerful and flexible way for OpenAI models to interface with external systems and access data outside their training data. This guide shows how you can connect a model to data and actions provided by your application. We'll show how to use function tools (defined by a JSON schema) and custom tools which work with free form text inputs and outputs.

How it works
------------

Let's begin by understanding a few key terms about tool calling. After we have a shared vocabulary for tool calling, we'll show you how it's done with some practical examples.

Tools - functionality we give the model

A **function** or **tool** refers in the abstract to a piece of functionality that we tell the model it has access to. As a model generates a response to a prompt, it may decide that it needs data or functionality provided by a tool to follow the prompt's instructions.

You could give the model access to tools that:

*   Get today's weather for a location
*   Access account details for a given user ID
*   Issue refunds for a lost order

Or anything else you'd like the model to be able to know or do as it responds to a prompt.

When we make an API request to the model with a prompt, we can include a list of tools the model could consider using. For example, if we wanted the model to be able to answer questions about the current weather somewhere in the world, we might give it access to a `get_weather` tool that takes `location` as an argument.

Tool calls - requests from the model to use tools

A **function call** or **tool call** refers to a special kind of response we can get from the model if it examines a prompt, and then determines that in order to follow the instructions in the prompt, it needs to call one of the tools we made available to it.

If the model receives a prompt like "what is the weather in Paris?" in an API request, it could respond to that prompt with a tool call for the `get_weather` tool, with `Paris` as the `location` argument.

Tool call outputs - output we generate for the model

A **function call output** or **tool call output** refers to the response a tool generates using the input from a model's tool call. The tool call output can either be structured JSON or plain text, and it should contain a reference to a specific model tool call (referenced by `call_id` in the examples to come). To complete our weather example:

*   The model has access to a `get_weather` **tool** that takes `location` as an argument.
*   In response to a prompt like "what's the weather in Paris?" the model returns a **tool call** that contains a `location` argument with a value of `Paris`
*   The **tool call output** might return a JSON object (e.g., `{"temperature": "25", "unit": "C"}`, indicating a current temperature of 25 degrees), [Image contents](/docs/guides/images), or [File contents](/docs/guides/pdf-files).

We then send all of the tool definition, the original prompt, the model's tool call, and the tool call output back to the model to finally receive a text response like:

```text
The weather in Paris today is 25C.
```

Functions versus tools

*   A function is a specific kind of tool, defined by a JSON schema. A function definition allows the model to pass data to your application, where your code can access data or take actions suggested by the model.
*   In addition to function tools, there are custom tools (described in this guide) that work with free text inputs and outputs.
*   There are also [built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools) that are part of the OpenAI platform. These tools enable the model to [search the web](/docs/guides/tools-web-search), [execute code](/docs/guides/tools-code-interpreter), access the functionality of an [MCP server](/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp), and more.

### The tool calling flow

Tool calling is a multi-step conversation between your application and a model via the OpenAI API. The tool calling flow has five high level steps:

1.  Make a request to the model with tools it could call
2.  Receive a tool call from the model
3.  Execute code on the application side with input from the tool call
4.  Make a second request to the model with the tool output
5.  Receive a final response from the model (or more tool calls)

Function tool example
---------------------

Let's look at an end-to-end tool calling flow for a `get_horoscope` function that gets a daily horoscope for an astrological sign.

Complete tool calling example

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()

# 1. Define a list of callable tools for the model
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_horoscope",
        "description": "Get today's horoscope for an astrological sign.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "sign": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "An astrological sign like Taurus or Aquarius",
                },
            },
            "required": ["sign"],
        },
    },
]

def get_horoscope(sign):
    return f"{sign}: Next Tuesday you will befriend a baby otter."

# Create a running input list we will add to over time
input_list = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is my horoscope? I am an Aquarius."}
]

# 2. Prompt the model with tools defined
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=tools,
    input=input_list,
)

# Save function call outputs for subsequent requests
input_list += response.output

for item in response.output:
    if item.type == "function_call":
        if item.name == "get_horoscope":
            # 3. Execute the function logic for get_horoscope
            horoscope = get_horoscope(json.loads(item.arguments))
            
            # 4. Provide function call results to the model
            input_list.append({
                "type": "function_call_output",
                "call_id": item.call_id,
                "output": json.dumps({
                  "horoscope": horoscope
                })
            })

print("Final input:")
print(input_list)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    instructions="Respond only with a horoscope generated by a tool.",
    tools=tools,
    input=input_list,
)

# 5. The model should be able to give a response!
print("Final output:")
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
print("\n" + response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

// 1. Define a list of callable tools for the model
const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "get_horoscope",
    description: "Get today's horoscope for an astrological sign.",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        sign: {
          type: "string",
          description: "An astrological sign like Taurus or Aquarius",
        },
      },
      required: ["sign"],
    },
  },
];

function getHoroscope(sign) {
  return sign + " Next Tuesday you will befriend a baby otter.";
}

// Create a running input list we will add to over time
let input = [
  { role: "user", content: "What is my horoscope? I am an Aquarius." },
];

// 2. Prompt the model with tools defined
let response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  tools,
  input,
});

response.output.forEach((item) => {
  if (item.type == "function_call") {
    if (item.name == "get_horoscope"):
      // 3. Execute the function logic for get_horoscope
      const horoscope = get_horoscope(JSON.parse(item.arguments))
      
      // 4. Provide function call results to the model
      input_list.push({
          type: "function_call_output",
          call_id: item.call_id,
          output: json.dumps({
            horoscope
          })
      })
  }
});

console.log("Final input:");
console.log(JSON.stringify(input, null, 2));

response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  instructions: "Respond only with a horoscope generated by a tool.",
  tools,
  input,
});

// 5. The model should be able to give a response!
console.log("Final output:");
console.log(JSON.stringify(response.output, null, 2));
```

Note that for reasoning models like GPT-5 or o4-mini, any reasoning items returned in model responses with tool calls must also be passed back with tool call outputs.

Defining functions
------------------

Functions can be set in the `tools` parameter of each API request. A function is defined by its schema, which informs the model what it does and what input arguments it expects. A function definition has the following properties:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|type|This should always be function|
|name|The function's name (e.g. get_weather)|
|description|Details on when and how to use the function|
|parameters|JSON schema defining the function's input arguments|
|strict|Whether to enforce strict mode for the function call|

Here is an example function definition for a `get_weather` function

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogot√°, Colombia"
            },
            "units": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
            }
        },
        "required": ["location", "units"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "strict": true
}
```

Because the `parameters` are defined by a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/), you can leverage many of its rich features like property types, enums, descriptions, nested objects, and, recursive objects.

### Best practices for defining functions

1.  **Write clear and detailed function names, parameter descriptions, and instructions.**
    
    *   **Explicitly describe the purpose of the function and each parameter** (and its format), and what the output represents.
    *   **Use the system prompt to describe when (and when not) to use each function.** Generally, tell the model _exactly_ what to do.
    *   **Include examples and edge cases**, especially to rectify any recurring failures. (**Note:** Adding examples may hurt performance for [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning).)
2.  **Apply software engineering best practices.**
    
    *   **Make the functions obvious and intuitive**. ([principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment))
    *   **Use enums** and object structure to make invalid states unrepresentable. (e.g. `toggle_light(on: bool, off: bool)` allows for invalid calls)
    *   **Pass the intern test.** Can an intern/human correctly use the function given nothing but what you gave the model? (If not, what questions do they ask you? Add the answers to the prompt.)
3.  **Offload the burden from the model and use code where possible.**
    
    *   **Don't make the model fill arguments you already know.** For example, if you already have an `order_id` based on a previous menu, don't have an `order_id` param ‚Äì instead, have no params `submit_refund()` and pass the `order_id` with code.
    *   **Combine functions that are always called in sequence.** For example, if you always call `mark_location()` after `query_location()`, just move the marking logic into the query function call.
4.  **Keep the number of functions small for higher accuracy.**
    
    *   **Evaluate your performance** with different numbers of functions.
    *   **Aim for fewer than 20 functions** at any one time, though this is just a soft suggestion.
5.  **Leverage OpenAI resources.**
    
    *   **Generate and iterate on function schemas** in the [Playground](/playground).
    *   **Consider [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) to increase function calling accuracy** for large numbers of functions or difficult tasks. ([cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine_tuning_for_function_calling))

### Token Usage

Under the hood, functions are injected into the system message in a syntax the model has been trained on. This means functions count against the model's context limit and are billed as input tokens. If you run into token limits, we suggest limiting the number of functions or the length of the descriptions you provide for function parameters.

It is also possible to use [fine-tuning](/docs/guides/fine-tuning#fine-tuning-examples) to reduce the number of tokens used if you have many functions defined in your tools specification.

Handling function calls
-----------------------

When the model calls a function, you must execute it and return the result. Since model responses can include zero, one, or multiple calls, it is best practice to assume there are several.

The response `output` array contains an entry with the `type` having a value of `function_call`. Each entry with a `call_id` (used later to submit the function result), `name`, and JSON-encoded `arguments`.

Sample response with multiple function calls

```json
[
    {
        "id": "fc_12345xyz",
        "call_id": "call_12345xyz",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"
    },
    {
        "id": "fc_67890abc",
        "call_id": "call_67890abc",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Bogot√°, Colombia\"}"
    },
    {
        "id": "fc_99999def",
        "call_id": "call_99999def",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "send_email",
        "arguments": "{\"to\":\"bob@email.com\",\"body\":\"Hi bob\"}"
    }
]
```

Execute function calls and append results

```python
for tool_call in response.output:
    if tool_call.type != "function_call":
        continue

    name = tool_call.name
    args = json.loads(tool_call.arguments)

    result = call_function(name, args)
    input_messages.append({
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": tool_call.call_id,
        "output": str(result)
    })
```

```javascript
for (const toolCall of response.output) {
    if (toolCall.type !== "function_call") {
        continue;
    }

    const name = toolCall.name;
    const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.arguments);

    const result = callFunction(name, args);
    input.push({
        type: "function_call_output",
        call_id: toolCall.call_id,
        output: result.toString()
    });
}
```

In the example above, we have a hypothetical `call_function` to route each call. Here‚Äôs a possible implementation:

Execute function calls and append results

```python
def call_function(name, args):
    if name == "get_weather":
        return get_weather(**args)
    if name == "send_email":
        return send_email(**args)
```

```javascript
const callFunction = async (name, args) => {
    if (name === "get_weather") {
        return getWeather(args.latitude, args.longitude);
    }
    if (name === "send_email") {
        return sendEmail(args.to, args.body);
    }
};
```

### Formatting results

A result must be a string, but the format is up to you (JSON, error codes, plain text, etc.). The model will interpret that string as needed.

If your function has no return value (e.g. `send_email`), simply return a string to indicate success or failure. (e.g. `"success"`)

### Incorporating results into response

After appending the results to your `input`, you can send them back to the model to get a final response.

Send results back to model

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=input_messages,
    tools=tools,
)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input,
    tools,
});
```

Final response

```json
"It's about 15¬∞C in Paris, 18¬∞C in Bogot√°, and I've sent that email to Bob."
```

Additional configurations
-------------------------

### Tool choice

By default the model will determine when and how many tools to use. You can force specific behavior with the `tool_choice` parameter.

1.  **Auto:** (_Default_) Call zero, one, or multiple functions. `tool_choice: "auto"`
2.  **Required:** Call one or more functions. `tool_choice: "required"`
3.  **Forced Function:** Call exactly one specific function. `tool_choice: {"type": "function", "name": "get_weather"}`
4.  **Allowed tools:** Restrict the tool calls the model can make to a subset of the tools available to the model.

**When to use allowed\_tools**

You might want to configure an `allowed_tools` list in case you want to make only a subset of tools available across model requests, but not modify the list of tools you pass in, so you can maximize savings from [prompt caching](/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

```json
"tool_choice": {
    "type": "allowed_tools",
    "mode": "auto",
    "tools": [
        { "type": "function", "name": "get_weather" },
        { "type": "function", "name": "search_docs" }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also set `tool_choice` to `"none"` to imitate the behavior of passing no functions.

### Parallel function calling

Parallel function calling is not possible when using [built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools).

The model may choose to call multiple functions in a single turn. You can prevent this by setting `parallel_tool_calls` to `false`, which ensures exactly zero or one tool is called.

**Note:** Currently, if you are using a fine tuned model and the model calls multiple functions in one turn then [strict mode](/docs/guides/function-calling#strict-mode) will be disabled for those calls.

**Note for `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14`:** This snapshot of `gpt-4.1-nano` can sometimes include multiple tools calls for the same tool if parallel tool calls are enabled. It is recommended to disable this feature when using this nano snapshot.

### Strict mode

Setting `strict` to `true` will ensure function calls reliably adhere to the function schema, instead of being best effort. We recommend always enabling strict mode.

Under the hood, strict mode works by leveraging our [structured outputs](/docs/guides/structured-outputs) feature and therefore introduces a couple requirements:

1.  `additionalProperties` must be set to `false` for each object in the `parameters`.
2.  All fields in `properties` must be marked as `required`.

You can denote optional fields by adding `null` as a `type` option (see example below).

Strict mode enabled

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogot√°, Colombia"
            },
            "units": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
            }
        },
        "required": ["location", "units"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Strict mode disabled

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogot√°, Colombia"
            },
            "units": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
            }
        },
        "required": ["location"],
    }
}
```

All schemas generated in the [playground](/playground) have strict mode enabled.

While we recommend you enable strict mode, it has a few limitations:

1.  Some features of JSON schema are not supported. (See [supported schemas](/docs/guides/structured-outputs?context=with_parse#supported-schemas).)

Specifically for fine tuned models:

1.  Schemas undergo additional processing on the first request (and are then cached). If your schemas vary from request to request, this may result in higher latencies.
2.  Schemas are cached for performance, and are not eligible for [zero data retention](/docs/models#how-we-use-your-data).

Streaming
---------

Streaming can be used to surface progress by showing which function is called as the model fills its arguments, and even displaying the arguments in real time.

Streaming function calls is very similar to streaming regular responses: you set `stream` to `true` and get different `event` objects.

Streaming function calls

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogot√°, Colombia"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "location"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": False
    }
}]

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools,
    stream=True
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const tools = [{
    type: "function",
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            latitude: { type: "number" },
            longitude: { type: "number" }
        },
        required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
        additionalProperties: false
    },
    strict: true
}];

const stream = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?" }],
    tools,
    stream: true,
    store: true,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log(event)
}
```

{"type":"response.output_item.done","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","output_index":0,"item":{"type":"function_call","id":"fc_1234xyz","call_id":"call_1234xyz","name":"get_weather","arguments":"{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"}}
```

Instead of aggregating chunks into a single `content` string, however, you're aggregating chunks into an encoded `arguments` JSON object.

When the model calls one or more functions an event of type `response.output_item.added` will be emitted for each function call that contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This represents the individual function calls in the response.|
|item|The in-progress function call item that includes a name, arguments and id field|

Afterwards you will receive a series of events of type `response.function_call_arguments.delta` which will contain the `delta` of the `arguments` field. These events contain the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|item_id|The id of the function call item that the delta belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This represents the individual function calls in the response.|
|delta|The delta of the arguments field.|

Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to aggregate the `delta`s into a final `tool_call` object.

Accumulating tool\_call deltas

```python
final_tool_calls = {}

for event in stream:
    if event.type === 'response.output_item.added':
        final_tool_calls[event.output_index] = event.item;
    elif event.type === 'response.function_call_arguments.delta':
        index = event.output_index

        if final_tool_calls[index]:
            final_tool_calls[index].arguments += event.delta
```

```javascript
const finalToolCalls = {};

for await (const event of stream) {
    if (event.type === 'response.output_item.added') {
        finalToolCalls[event.output_index] = event.item;
    } else if (event.type === 'response.function_call_arguments.delta') {
        const index = event.output_index;

        if (finalToolCalls[index]) {
            finalToolCalls[index].arguments += event.delta;
        }
    }
}
```

Accumulated final\_tool\_calls\[0\]

```json
{
    "type": "function_call",
    "id": "fc_1234xyz",
    "call_id": "call_2345abc",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"
}
```

When the model has finished calling the functions an event of type `response.function_call_arguments.done` will be emitted. This event contains the entire function call including the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This represents the individual function calls in the response.|
|item|The function call item that includes a name, arguments and id field.|

Custom tools
------------

Custom tools work in much the same way as JSON schema-driven function tools. But rather than providing the model explicit instructions on what input your tool requires, the model can pass an arbitrary string back to your tool as input. This is useful to avoid unnecessarily wrapping a response in JSON, or to apply a custom grammar to the response (more on this below).

The following code sample shows creating a custom tool that expects to receive a string of text containing Python code as a response.

Custom tool calling example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Use the code_exec tool to print hello world to the console.",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "custom",
            "name": "code_exec",
            "description": "Executes arbitrary Python code.",
        }
    ]
)
print(response.output)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: "Use the code_exec tool to print hello world to the console.",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "custom",
      name: "code_exec",
      description: "Executes arbitrary Python code.",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output);
```

Just as before, the `output` array will contain a tool call generated by the model. Except this time, the tool call input is given as plain text.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "rs_6890e972fa7c819ca8bc561526b989170694874912ae0ea6",
        "type": "reasoning",
        "content": [],
        "summary": []
    },
    {
        "id": "ctc_6890e975e86c819c9338825b3e1994810694874912ae0ea6",
        "type": "custom_tool_call",
        "status": "completed",
        "call_id": "call_aGiFQkRWSWAIsMQ19fKqxUgb",
        "input": "print(\"hello world\")",
        "name": "code_exec"
    }
]
```

Context-free grammars
---------------------

A [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) (CFG) is a set of rules that define how to produce valid text in a given format. For custom tools, you can provide a CFG that will constrain the model's text input for a custom tool.

You can provide a custom CFG using the `grammar` parameter when configuring a custom tool. Currently, we support two CFG syntaxes when defining grammars: `lark` and `regex`.

Lark CFG
--------

Lark context free grammar example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

grammar = """
start: expr
expr: term (SP ADD SP term)* -> add
| term
term: factor (SP MUL SP factor)* -> mul
| factor
factor: INT
SP: " "
ADD: "+"
MUL: "*"
%import common.INT
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Use the math_exp tool to add four plus four.",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "custom",
            "name": "math_exp",
            "description": "Creates valid mathematical expressions",
            "format": {
                "type": "grammar",
                "syntax": "lark",
                "definition": grammar,
            },
        }
    ]
)
print(response.output)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const grammar = `
start: expr
expr: term (SP ADD SP term)* -> add
| term
term: factor (SP MUL SP factor)* -> mul
| factor
factor: INT
SP: " "
ADD: "+"
MUL: "*"
%import common.INT
`;

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: "Use the math_exp tool to add four plus four.",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "custom",
      name: "math_exp",
      description: "Creates valid mathematical expressions",
      format: {
        type: "grammar",
        syntax: "lark",
        definition: grammar,
      },
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output);
```

The output from the tool should then conform to the Lark CFG that you defined:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "rs_6890ed2b6374819dbbff5353e6664ef103f4db9848be4829",
        "type": "reasoning",
        "content": [],
        "summary": []
    },
    {
        "id": "ctc_6890ed2f32e8819daa62bef772b8c15503f4db9848be4829",
        "type": "custom_tool_call",
        "status": "completed",
        "call_id": "call_pmlLjmvG33KJdyVdC4MVdk5N",
        "input": "4 + 4",
        "name": "math_exp"
    }
]
```

Grammars are specified using a variation of [Lark](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). Model sampling is constrained using [LLGuidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/llguidance/blob/main/docs/syntax.md). Some features of Lark are not supported:

*   Lookarounds in lexer regexes
*   Lazy modifiers (`*?`, `+?`, `??`) in lexer regexes
*   Priorities of terminals
*   Templates
*   Imports (other than built-in `%import` common)
*   `%declare`s

We recommend using the [Lark IDE](https://www.lark-parser.org/ide/) to experiment with custom grammars.

### Keep grammars simple

Try to make your grammar as simple as possible. The OpenAI API may return an error if the grammar is too complex, so you should ensure that your desired grammar is compatible before using it in the API.

Lark grammars can be tricky to perfect. While simple grammars perform most reliably, complex grammars often require iteration on the grammar definition itself, the prompt, and the tool description to ensure that the model does not go out of distribution.

### Correct versus incorrect patterns

Correct (single, bounded terminal):

```text
start: SENTENCE
SENTENCE: /[A-Za-z, ]*(the hero|a dragon|an old man|the princess)[A-Za-z, ]*(fought|saved|found|lost)[A-Za-z, ]*(a treasure|the kingdom|a secret|his way)[A-Za-z, ]*\./
```

Do NOT do this (splitting across rules/terminals). This attempts to let rules partition free text between terminals. The lexer will greedily match the free-text pieces and you'll lose control:

```text
start: sentence
sentence: /[A-Za-z, ]+/ subject /[A-Za-z, ]+/ verb /[A-Za-z, ]+/ object /[A-Za-z, ]+/
```

Lowercase rules don't influence how terminals are cut from the input‚Äîonly terminal definitions do. When you need ‚Äúfree text between anchors,‚Äù make it one giant regex terminal so the lexer matches it exactly once with the structure you intend.

### Terminals versus rules

Lark uses terminals for lexer tokens (by convention, `UPPERCASE`) and rules for parser productions (by convention, `lowercase`). The most practical way to stay within the supported subset and avoid surprises is to keep your grammar simple and explicit, and to use terminals and rules with a clear separation of concerns.

The regex syntax used by terminals is the [Rust regex crate syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax), not Python's `re` [module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

### Key ideas and best practices

**Lexer runs before the parser**

Terminals are matched by the lexer (greedily / longest match wins) before any CFG rule logic is applied. If you try to "shape" a terminal by splitting it across several rules, the lexer cannot be guided by those rules‚Äîonly by terminal regexes.

**Prefer one terminal when you're carving text out of freeform spans**

If you need to recognize a pattern embedded in arbitrary text (e.g., natural language with ‚Äúanything‚Äù between anchors), express that as a single terminal. Do not try to interleave free‚Äëtext terminals with parser rules; the greedy lexer will not respect your intended boundaries and it is highly likely the model will go out of distribution.

**Use rules to compose discrete tokens**

Rules are ideal when you're combining clearly delimited terminals (numbers, keywords, punctuation) into larger structures. They're not the right tool for constraining "the stuff in between" two terminals.

**Keep terminals simple, bounded, and self-contained**

Favor explicit character classes and bounded quantifiers (`{0,10}`, not unbounded `*` everywhere). If you need "any text up to a period", prefer something like `/[^.\n]{0,10}*\./` rather than `/.+\./` to avoid runaway growth.

**Use rules to combine tokens, not to steer regex internals**

Good rule usage example:

```text
start: expr
NUMBER: /[0-9]+/
PLUS: "+"
MINUS: "-"
expr: term (("+"|"-") term)*
term: NUMBER
```

**Treat whitespace explicitly**

Don't rely on open-ended `%ignore` directives. Using unbounded ignore directives may cause the grammar to be too complex and/or may cause the model to go out of distribution. Prefer threading explicit terminals wherever whitespace is allowed.

### Troubleshooting

*   If the API rejects the grammar because it is too complex, simplify the rules and terminals and remove unbounded `%ignore`s.
*   If custom tools are called with unexpected tokens, confirm terminals aren‚Äôt overlapping; check greedy lexer.
*   When the model drifts "out‚Äëof‚Äëdistribution" (shows up as the model producing excessively long or repetitive outputs, it is syntactically valid but is semantically wrong):
    *   Tighten the grammar.
    *   Iterate on the prompt (add few-shot examples) and tool description (explain the grammar and instruct the model to reason and conform to it).
    *   Experiment with a higher reasoning effort (e.g, bump from medium to high).

Regex CFG
---------

Regex context free grammar example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

grammar = r"^(?P<month>January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\s+(?P<day>\d{1,2})(?:st|nd|rd|th)?\s+(?P<year>\d{4})\s+at\s+(?P<hour>0?[1-9]|1[0-2])(?P<ampm>AM|PM)$"

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Use the timestamp tool to save a timestamp for August 7th 2025 at 10AM.",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "custom",
            "name": "timestamp",
            "description": "Saves a timestamp in date + time in 24-hr format.",
            "format": {
                "type": "grammar",
                "syntax": "regex",
                "definition": grammar,
            },
        }
    ]
)
print(response.output)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const grammar = "^(?P<month>January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\s+(?P<day>\d{1,2})(?:st|nd|rd|th)?\s+(?P<year>\d{4})\s+at\s+(?P<hour>0?[1-9]|1[0-2])(?P<ampm>AM|PM)$";

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: "Use the timestamp tool to save a timestamp for August 7th 2025 at 10AM.",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "custom",
      name: "timestamp",
      description: "Saves a timestamp in date + time in 24-hr format.",
      format: {
        type: "grammar",
        syntax: "regex",
        definition: grammar,
      },
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output);
```

The output from the tool should then conform to the Regex CFG that you defined:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "rs_6894f7a3dd4c81a1823a723a00bfa8710d7962f622d1c260",
        "type": "reasoning",
        "content": [],
        "summary": []
    },
    {
        "id": "ctc_6894f7ad7fb881a1bffa1f377393b1a40d7962f622d1c260",
        "type": "custom_tool_call",
        "status": "completed",
        "call_id": "call_8m4XCnYvEmFlzHgDHbaOCFlK",
        "input": "August 7th 2025 at 10AM",
        "name": "timestamp"
    }
]
```

As with the Lark syntax, regexes use the [Rust regex crate syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax), not Python's `re` [module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

Some features of Regex are not supported:

*   Lookarounds
*   Lazy modifiers (`*?`, `+?`, `??`)

### Key ideas and best practices

**Pattern must be on one line**

If you need to match a newline in the input, use the escaped sequence `\n`. Do not use verbose/extended mode, which allows patterns to span multiple lines.

**Provide the regex as a plain pattern string**

Don't enclose the pattern in `//`.

Structured model outputs
========================

Ensure text responses from the model adhere to a JSON schema you define.

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
  },
});

const event = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
        },
    ],
    text_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = response.output_parsed
```

### Supported models

Structured Outputs is available in our [latest large language models](/docs/models), starting with GPT-4o. Older models like `gpt-4-turbo` and earlier may use [JSON mode](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode) instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via text.format

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

1.  When using [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling)
2.  When using a `json_schema` response format

Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via `response_format` are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

*   If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling - If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured `text.format`

The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Responses API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the

[

Function Calling

](/docs/guides/function-calling#function-calling-with-structured-outputs)

guide.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode

Structured Outputs is the evolution of [JSON mode](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode). While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherence. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API, Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` is only supported with the `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, and `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model snapshots and later.

||Structured Outputs|JSON Mode|
|---|---|---|
|Outputs valid JSON|Yes|Yes|
|Adheres to schema|Yes (see supported schemas)|No|
|Compatible models|gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later|gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models|
|Enabling|text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ... } }|text: { format: { type: "json_object" } }|

Examples
--------

Chain of thought

### Chain of thought

You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
  },
});

const math_reasoning = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
    ],
    text_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = response.output_parsed

Structured data extraction

### Structured data extraction

You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as research papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
  },
});

const research_paper = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    ],
    text_format=ResearchPaperExtraction,
)

research_paper = response.output_parsed

UI generation

### UI Generation

You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const UI = z.lazy(() =>
  z.object({
    type: z.enum(["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]),
    label: z.string(),
    children: z.array(UI),
    attributes: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        value: z.string(),
      })
    ),
  })
);

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Make a User Profile Form",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(UI, "ui"),
  },
});

const ui = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class UIType(str, Enum):
    div = "div"
    button = "button"
    header = "header"
    section = "section"
    field = "field"

class Attribute(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: str

class UI(BaseModel):
    type: UIType
    label: str
    children: List["UI"]
    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild()  # This is required to enable recursive types

class Response(BaseModel):
    ui: UI

response = client.responses.parse(

Moderation

### Moderation

You can classify inputs on multiple categories, which is a common way of doing moderation.

Moderation using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ContentCompliance = z.object({
  is_violating: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["violence", "sexual", "self_harm"]).nullable(),
  explanation_if_violating: z.string().nullable(),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Determine if the user input violates specific guidelines and explain if they do."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How do I prepare for a job interview?"
      }
    ],
    text: {
        format: zodTextFormat(ContentCompliance, "content_compliance"),
    },
});

const compliance = response.output_parsed;
```

```python

    sexual = "sexual"
    self_harm = "self_harm"

How to use Structured Outputs with text.format
----------------------------------------------

Step 1: Define your schema

First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

#### Tips for your JSON Schema

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call

To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

```json
text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ‚Ä¶ } }
```

For example:

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    text={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "name": "math_response",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "steps": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                "output": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                            "additionalProperties": False
                        }
                    },
                    "final_answer": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            },
            "strict": True
        }
    }
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },

        "role": "user",
        "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      }
    ],
    "text": {
      "format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "name": "math_response",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "steps": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "explanation": { "type": "string" },
                  "output": { "type": "string" }
                },
                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                "additionalProperties": false
              }
            },
            "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 50,
    text: {
      format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    }
  });

  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = response.output[0].content[0];

  if (math_response.type === "refusal") {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.type === "output_text") {
    console.log(math_response.text);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}
```

```python
try:
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        input=[
            {

                "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
        ],
        text={

                "strict": True,
                "schema": {

                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {

                                },
                                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                                "additionalProperties": False,
                            },
                        },
                        "final_answer": {"type": "string"},
                    },
                    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
                "strict": True,
            },
        },
    )
except Exception as e:
    # handle errors like finish_reason, refusal, content_filter, etc.
    pass
```

### 

Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in `response_format`, the API response will include a new field called `refusal` to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the `refusal` property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

```python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
steps: list[Step]
final_answer: str

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
{"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
],
response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message

if (math_reasoning.refusal):
print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
print(math_reasoning.parsed)
```

```javascript
const Step = z.object({
explanation: z.string(),
output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
steps: z.array(Step),
final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
messages: [
{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
{ role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
],
response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}
```

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "resp_1234567890",
  "object": "response",
  "created_at": 1721596428,
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null,
  "incomplete_details": null,
  "input": [],
  "instructions": null,
  "max_output_tokens": null,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "output": [{
    "id": "msg_1234567890",
    "type": "message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "refusal",
        "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
      }
    ]
  }],
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 81,
    "output_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 92,
    "output_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0,
    }
  },
}
```

Tips and best practices

#### Handling user-generated input

If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

#### Handling mistakes

Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

#### Avoid JSON schema divergence

To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
---------

You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs.

```python
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
    attributes: List[str]
    colors: List[str]
    animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.responses.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
        },
    ],
    text_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "response.refusal.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.error":
            print(event.error, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.completed":
            print("Completed")
            # print(event.response.output)

    final_response = stream.get_final_response()
    print(final_response)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const EntitiesSchema = z.object({
  attributes: z.array(z.string()),
  colors: z.array(z.string()),
  animals: z.array(z.string()),
});

const openai = new OpenAI();
const stream = openai.responses
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
      { role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?" },
    ],
    text: {
      format: zodTextFormat(EntitiesSchema, "entities"),
    },
  })
  .on("response.refusal.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.done", () => {
    process.stdout.write("\n");
  })
  .on("response.error", (event) => {
    console.error(event.error);
  });

const result = await stream.finalResponse();

console.log(result);
```

Supported schemas
-----------------

Structured Outputs supports a subset of the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) language.

#### Supported types

The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

*   String
*   Number
*   Boolean
*   Integer
*   Object
*   Array
*   Enum
*   anyOf

#### Supported properties

In addition to specifying the type of a property, you can specify a selection of additional constraints:

**Supported `string` properties:**

*   `pattern` ‚Äî A regular expression that the string must match.
*   `format` ‚Äî Predefined formats for strings. Currently supported:
    *   `date-time`
    *   `time`
    *   `date`
    *   `duration`
    *   `email`
    *   `hostname`
    *   `ipv4`
    *   `ipv6`
    *   `uuid`

**Supported `number` properties:**

*   `multipleOf` ‚Äî The number must be a multiple of this value.
*   `maximum` ‚Äî The number must be less than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMaximum` ‚Äî The number must be less than this value.
*   `minimum` ‚Äî The number must be greater than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMinimum` ‚Äî The number must be greater than this value.

**Supported `array` properties:**

*   `minItems` ‚Äî The array must have at least this many items.
*   `maxItems` ‚Äî The array must have at most this many items.

Here are some examples on how you can use these type restrictions:

String Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "user_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The name of the user"
            },
            "username": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The username of the user. Must start with @",
                "pattern": "^@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
            },
            "email": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The email of the user",
                "format": "email"
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "name", "username", "email"
        ]
    }
}
```

Number Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "weather_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            },
            "value": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The actual temperature value in the location",
                "minimum": -130,
                "maximum": 130
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit", "value"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note these constraints are [not yet supported for fine-tuned models](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported).

#### Root objects must not be `anyOf` and must be an object

Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use `anyOf`. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an `anyOf` at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
BaseResponseSchema,
UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
```

#### All fields must be `required`

To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as `required`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
```

Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with `null`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size

A schema may have up to 5000 object properties total, with up to 10 levels of nesting.

#### Limitations on total string size

In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 120,000 characters.

#### Limitations on enum size

A schema may have up to 1000 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 15,000 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

#### `additionalProperties: false` must always be set in objects

`additionalProperties` controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set `additionalProperties: false` to opt into Structured Outputs.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Key ordering

When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

#### Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported

*   **Composition:** `allOf`, `not`, `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, `if`, `then`, `else`

For fine-tuned models, we additionally do not support the following:

*   **For strings:** `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`
*   **For numbers:** `minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`
*   **For objects:** `patternProperties`
*   **For arrays:** `minItems`, `maxItems`

If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying `strict: true` and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

#### For `anyOf`, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset

Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "item": {
            "anyOf": [
                {

#### Definitions are supported

You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "steps": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
            }
        },
        "final_answer": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "step": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "explanation": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "output": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "explanation",
                "output"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "steps",
        "final_answer"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### Recursive schemas are supported

Sample recursive schema using `#` to indicate root recursion.

```json
{
    "name": "ui",
    "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The type of the UI component",
                "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
            },
            "label": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
            },
            "children": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Nested UI components",
                "items": {
                    "$ref": "#"
                }
            },
            "attributes": {
                "type": "array",

                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The value of the attribute"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": ["name", "value"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "linked_list": {
            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "linked_list_node": {

                "value": {
                    "type": "number"
                },
                "next": {
                    "anyOf": [
                        {
                            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "null"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
                "next",
                "value"
            ]

    "required": [
        "linked_list"
    ]
}
```

JSON mode
---------

JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Responses API you can set the `text.format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

*   When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
*   JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
*   Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)

Handling edge cases

```javascript
const we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens = true;

try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    input: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020? Please respond in the format {winner: ...}" },
    ],
    text: { format: { type: "json_object" } },
  });

  // Check if the conversation was too long for the context window, resulting in incomplete JSON 
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  // Check if the OpenAI safety system refused the request and generated a refusal instead
  if (response.output[0].content[0].type === "refusal") {
    // your code should handle this error case
    // In this case, the .content field will contain the explanation (if any) that the model generated for why it is refusing
    console.log(response.output[0].content[0].refusal)
  }

  // Check if the model's output included restricted content, so the generation of JSON was halted and may be partial
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "content_filter") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  if (response.status === "completed") {
    // In this case the model has either successfully finished generating the JSON object according to your schema, or the model generated one of the tokens you provided as a "stop token"

    if (we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens) {
      // If you didn't specify any stop tokens, then the generation is complete and the content key will contain the serialized JSON object
      // This will parse successfully and should now contain  {"winner": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}
      console.log(JSON.parse(response.output_text))
    } else {
      // Check if the response.output_text ends with one of your stop tokens and handle appropriately
    }
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Your code should handle errors here, for example a network error calling the API
  console.error(e)
}
```
