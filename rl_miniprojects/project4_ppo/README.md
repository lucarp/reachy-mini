# Project 4: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

**Status**: üöß Coming Soon
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Estimated Time**: 4 days

---

## Overview

PPO is the current state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithm used in most modern RL applications (including Phase 3!).

**Key Features**:
- Clipped objective function for stable updates
- Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Mini-batch updates for sample efficiency
- Simple to implement yet highly effective

**Used in**: OpenAI Five, AlphaGo, ChatGPT RLHF, and Phase 3 of this project!

## What You'll Learn

- ‚úÖ Importance sampling and policy ratios
- ‚úÖ Clipped surrogate objective
- ‚úÖ Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- ‚úÖ Mini-batch gradient descent
- ‚úÖ Trust region methods (intuition)
- ‚úÖ Compare with stable-baselines3 implementation

---

## Implementation Plan

This project will include:

1. **ppo_scratch.py** - PPO from scratch (your implementation)
2. **ppo_sb3.py** - Using stable-baselines3 (for comparison)
3. **train_scratch.py** - Train your PPO
4. **train_sb3.py** - Train stable-baselines3 PPO
5. **compare.py** - Compare both implementations
6. **README.md** - Complete theory guide (clipping, GAE, trust regions)

---

## Why PPO?

PPO is the **most popular RL algorithm** today because:

1. **Simple**: Easier to implement than TRPO
2. **Stable**: Clipping prevents destructive updates
3. **Sample efficient**: Better than REINFORCE and A2C
4. **General**: Works on continuous and discrete actions
5. **Proven**: Used in production systems

**This is the algorithm you'll use in Phase 3!**

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all previous projects first!

1. **Project 1 (REINFORCE)** - Policy gradients
2. **Project 2 (DQN)** - Value functions
3. **Project 3 (A2C)** - Actor-critic, advantage

PPO builds on ALL these concepts. Don't skip ahead!

## After Completing PPO

You will:
- ‚úÖ Understand the most widely-used RL algorithm
- ‚úÖ Be ready to implement Phase 3 (Deep RL with Human-in-the-Loop)
- ‚úÖ Have a complete RL portfolio (REINFORCE ‚Üí DQN ‚Üí A2C ‚Üí PPO)
- ‚úÖ Be able to apply RL to new robotics tasks

**Then**: Move on to Phase 3 and use PPO with human feedback! üöÄ
